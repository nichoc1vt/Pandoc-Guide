To install Pandoc on your device, simply visit
<https://pandoc.org/installing.html> and scroll down until you find your
operating system or platform. Then, follow the given instructions.

For most major systems, installation will require the download of a
dedicated installer program. This program may need to be executed
manually following completion of the download. If this is the case, you
may need to open your file program (e.g. "File Explorer" on Windows or
"Finder" on Mac), find the "Download" tab in the sidebar on the right,
and double-click the newly-downloaded Pandoc installer program to run
it.
